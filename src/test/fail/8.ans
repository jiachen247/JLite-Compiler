Syntax error at character 4 of input
instead expected token classes are []
Error in line 4, column 5 : Failed to find a Main class! Jlite expects a the first class to be a Main class containing exactly one main method of type Void. Eg. Void main(...) { ... }.
         Common causes of this include,
                - missing main class
                - misspelling the 'main' function
                - having a return type other than `Void`
                - having additional functions in the main class
